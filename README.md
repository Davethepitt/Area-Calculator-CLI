# Area Calculator

### Introduction

In an effort to learn Python I'm trying to find little projects I can make which force learning and teach me some key skills. This is the first of those projects. The intention is to create some basic apps in the command line and reimagine it as a GUI app. I only share to get helpful feedback and encourage others to learn. 

Don't use this code as any form of good practise. I literally do not know what I'm doing. I have no doubt there would be very easy ways to streamline this code and make things work more efficiently but we all have to start somewhere.

### Details
This simple app runs in the command line and gives you the options to calculate the area of circles, triangles, rectangles and squares. There is basic input checking which is probably the thing I'd build on more.
